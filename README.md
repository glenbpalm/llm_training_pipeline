# Large-Scale LLM Training and Deployment Pipeline Using Ray & PyTorch

## Overview

This project demonstrates a distributed, large-scale Language Model (LLM) training and deployment pipeline using **Ray** for distributed computing and **PyTorch** for model training. It showcases the ability to handle large models in a scalable manner and provides insights into the infrastructure necessary for LLMOps.

## Key Features

- **Model Training**: Train a large language model (e.g., GPT-2) using PyTorch on a distributed infrastructure.
- **Distributed Training**: Implement distributed data-parallel or model-parallel techniques to train the model across multiple machines using Ray.
- **Model Deployment**: Create a scalable model inference service using Ray Serve for serving predictions.
- **Evaluation**: Implement a model evaluation pipeline that computes accuracy, perplexity, and inference latency for various configurations.
- **MLOps Tools**: Utilize MLflow or Weights & Biases for experiment tracking and model versioning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- Ray
- Ray Serve
- MLflow or Weights & Biases
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/llm_training_pipeline.git
cd llm_training_pipeline
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install the package
```bash
python setup.py install
```

### Configuration
Edit the configuration file `configs/config.yaml` to set hyperparameters, data paths, and other settings as needed.

## Data Preparation
Place your raw text files (`.txt`) in the `data/datasets/` directory. Use the data preparation script to preprocess the data:

```bash
python data/prepare_data.py
```

This script will:
- Load raw data files.
- Preprocess and tokenise the text.
- Split the data into training, validation and test sets.
- Save the processed data for training.

## Training
Initiate distributed training using Ray:
```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

This script will:
- Initialize Ray for distributed computing.
- Load configurations from `config.yaml`.
- Initialize the GPT-2 model defined in `models/gpt2_model.py`.
- Start distributed training across available nodes.

Training Options:
- **Distributed Data-Parallel (DDP)**: Distribute data batches across multiple GPUs or nodes.
- **Model-Parallel**: Split the model across multiple devices (for very large models).

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
```

This will compute:
- Accuracy
- Perplexity
- Inference Latency

Results will be saved in the `logs/` directory and tracked via MLflow or Weights & Biases.

## Deployment

Deploy the model using Ray Serve:
```bash
python scripts/deploy.py
```

This sets up a scalable, production-ready model inference service with RESTful API endpoints.

Features:
- Load balancing across multiple replicas.
- Scalable to handle high throughput.
- Easy integration with web services.

## Experiment Tracking

We use **MLflow** (or **Weights & Biases**) for tracking experiments.

### MLflow
1. Start MLflow server
```bash
mlflow ui
```

2. Access the MLflow UI
Open `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to view experiments.

### Weights & Biases
1. Login to W&B
```bash
wandb login
```

2. Track experiments

The training and evaluation scripts are configured to log metrics to W&B.

## Tutorial

Refer to the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/tutorial.ipynb` for a step-by-step guide on setting up distributed training using Ray and PyTorch.

## Results and Benchmarking

- Evaluation metrics are stored in the `logs/` directory.
- Benchmarking results include comparisons of training time, inference latency, and resource utilization under different configurations.
- Detailed analysis is available in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Testing

Run unit tests to ensure all components are working correctly:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
